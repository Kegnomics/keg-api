# Kegnomigs API

This serves the following purposes:

* pubmed querying based on keywords
* parsing of top variants and getings some keywords from that as well
* filtering the large number of variants that are created after the initial run on the vcf file


## API Design

Root: `/api`
Pubmed queries: `/api/pubmed`
